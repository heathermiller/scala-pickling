/*
  Test to indirectly generate a pickler for a type that contains private state
  by going through the `pickle` extension method.

  Some private state. Private field a var. Reassignable fields must be
  pickled, and because it's private, an accessor must be generated for this
  field. (Note that any non-constructor vals are typically assumed to be able
  to be initialized upon unpickling, and thus are not pickled.)
