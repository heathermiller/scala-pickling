### Getting Started Guide

With the exception of Java 1.6, this archive contains all that you will need to experiment with the scala-pickling project. To experiment with the scala-pickling project, you have a few choices:

1. **Our Test Suite**, tweak existing tests or add new tests to the >90 tests in our test suite.
2. **Our Benchmark Scripts**, reproduce our benchmark results locally on your architecture.
3. **scala-pickling's bootstrapped `scalac`**, write your own independent Scala programs and run them with the scala-pickling build of `scalac` (this is optional)

#### #1 Run The Tests (Or Add Your Own)

Our test suite can be run using SBT (a Scala build tool). SBT is included in this distribution (at `bin/sbt`). To start SBT simply do:

    ./bin/sbt
